# Introduction to Mongoose

Mongoose is an `Object Data Modeling` (ODM) library for MongoDB. Unlike MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database and does not enforce a specific schema for documents, Mongoose allows developers to define a schema for their data. This schema acts as a blueprint, providing a structured representation of the expected document structure.

Mongoose offers numerous built-in methods that facilitate interaction with MongoDB, making database operations more straightforward and organized.
